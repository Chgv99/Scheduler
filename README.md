# Add to server

<p align="center">
 :warning: The bot is currently WIP. This means that the database is subject to change at any moment, so any stored reminder, alarm or server configuration has a high probability of being erased. The link won't be available in this stage of the development.
</p>

# Features

You and your friends will be able to set useful reminders and alarms inside your Discord server for everyone to see.

1. Creating a reminder on the specified date and time with a title (and a description).
2. Setting up a broadcast channel
3. Specify the output channel for a specific reminder

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Future features:</b></summary>

1. Alarms (recurrent reminders)
2. Delete reminders and alarms

6. Assign different time zones for the multiple broadcast channels (if you have a friend in a different time zone this will be very helpful :smile:)

# Help

## üõ†Ô∏è **Set up**

To set up Scheduler, first you need to set a time zone for the server using ```>>chtimezone YourTimeZone```. It is set to UTC+0 by default.
For the moment, you only can set a time zone by using its full name (e.g. Atlantic/Canary, Europe/Madrid, etc...).

Check out [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) of time zones if you don\'t know yours. You can always see the current time zone of the server using `>>timezone` and the time using `>>time`.

:warning: Be careful, as having the expected time on your server does not mean that you got the correct time zone.
Not all time zones accomplish [DST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time), so having an incorrect time zone might cause an unexpected time offset on spring and summer.

## ‚ùï **Command prefix**

The default command prefix is `>>`. 

You can change it by using
```>>chprefix```

## :loudspeaker: Broadcast channel

Every time a reminder is sent, it'll be throught the *broadcast* channel. By default, the *broadcast* channel will be set to 'general'. This can be modified using

`>>chchannel newchannel`

## :calendar: Reminders

A reminder is used when you need to remember something once on a concrete date and time.
In the current version, you can create a reminder by specifying time, date, and a title.

`>>reminder dd-mm-yyyy hh-mm "title"`

Also, you can add a description, so you or your friends have some context on what you wanted to remind.

`>>reminder dd-mm-yyyy hh-mm "title" "description"`

These reminders will be sent by default through `general`. You can [change it](https://github.com/Chgv99/Scheduler/blob/main/README.md#loudspeaker-broadcast-channel) to whichever you want.
If you want to send a reminder through a different channel from the default you can specify it too. Just like this:

`>>reminder dd-mm-yyyy hh-mm "title" "description" channel`

:warning: Time must be specified using ISO 8601 format (24h).

:warning: The title and description of a reminder have to be enclosed in double quotes.
